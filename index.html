        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision for this project was to design a tool that can be used by any non-profit 
            organization in trying to understand and draw conclusions from their data through modeling. 
            The goal was to design an application that would allow the user to predict outcomes based on their data.
            This can be very confusing for people who do not understand how to build a model, so our goal was
            to provide a tool that is tailored to all of their needs that can be used by anyone. The idea was to have
            multiple models that the user could choose from to model different kinds of data.
        </p>
        <p>Our goal was to design a dashboard using Shiny in RStudio that could display all the modeling output. 
          In order to run this model we would wrangle a data set into a useable input for the dashboard. The data set in use was a
          financial data set for a non profit. This data would be provided for us in a contained environment by our project mentor,
          Carl McQueen.
